An attempt to figure out what I mean by "good code"

#### The Single Responsibility Principle is king

#### Tests pass in under a second

#### Pure and immutable where possible

#### Permissive and general rather than defensive and specific

#### Use inheritance with caution

#### Interfaces are hard; implementation is easy

#### Plain data objects are fine, even encouraged
